# Jockeys Conference Center Website 🏨

This project is my final submission for the "Human-Computer Interaction" course. It entails designing and developing a website for the Jockeys Conference Center. The website was initially designed using Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype, which was then translated into a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
